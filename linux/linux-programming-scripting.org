* Introduction
  Linux programming and scripting

* Linux
  Linux has three main parts
  + Kernel
  + Shell
  + File System

** Layers of Linux

** Shell
   - The shell is a program that sits as an interface between users
     and kernel.
   - It is a command interpreter and also has programming capability
     of its own.
   - Shell Types
     + Bourne Shell (sh) (First shell by Bourne Shell)
     + C Shell (sh)
     + Korn Shell (sh)
     + Bourne Again Shell (bash)   
 
** File System
   - Linux treats everything as a file including hardware devices.
   - Arranged as a directory hierarchy
   - The top level directory is known as "root (/)"

* Linux Commands
  - Commands tell the operating system to perform set of operations.
  - The syntax form of the commands are
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    command options arguments
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** chmod
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ chmod [user/group/other/all]+[permission] filename
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** whoami and who am i
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ whoami
   yogesh
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ who am i

   #+END_EXAMPLE

** tar
   tar stands for "to archive". It creates a new single file
   containing all the files.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ tar cvpf onefile.tar lab1 lab2 lab3
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** gzip
   gzip reduces the size of the named files using a compression
   algorithm. The original file will be replaced with a new compressed
   version.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ gzip onefile.tar
   #+END_EXAMPLE
