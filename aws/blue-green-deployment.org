* Introduction
  Blue Green Deployment of services.

* Blue/Green Deployment
  Blue/Green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by
  shifting traffic between two identical environments running
  different versions of the application. Blue/Green deployments
  provide near zero-downtime relase and rollback capabilities.

  After the green environment is ready and tested, production traffic
  is redirected from blue to green.

** Benefits
   - It ensures spinning up a parallel green environment does not
     affect resources and underpinning your blue environment.
   - No overwrites of faulty application
   - Rollback is easy
