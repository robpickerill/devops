* Introduction
This document describes the basic Linux commands that are used in a day to day
life of system administrator.

* Linux text processing
** cut
cut prints the selected sections of lines. For example below command prints 1st
and 3rd bytes of each line from file cat.txt. =-b= option specifies the range of
bytes, multiple ranges can be specified separated by comma.

#+END_EXAMPLE

command.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
head -n20
#+END_EXAMPLE
To print first 20 characters from a file.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
head -c20
#+END_EXAMPLE

** tail
tail command is used to print lines or characters from the end of the file. By
default it prints last 10 lines from a file. We can specify the count of lines
we want to print. For example to print last 20 lines we run following command.
