  | Domain Name                 | A Domain Name has a registered owner         |
  |                             | and the owner is authoritative and           |
  |                             | responsible for DNS information.             |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | Fully Qualified Domain Name | Defines a domain name to the root.           |
  | (FQDN)                      | A FQDN must therefore include the root       |
  |                             | which in turn means it must have a           |
  |                             | final DOT on the extreme right of the        |
  |                             | domain name. For example                     |
  |                             | www.example.com. is a FQDN whereas           |
  |                             | www.example.com is not (it does not          |
  |                             | terminate with a DOT)                        |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | host name                   | Fully defines a host within a domain,        |
  |                             | for example, fred.example.com is a host      |
  |                             | name.                                        |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | sub-domain name             | A sub-domain name will fully include         |
  |                             | the Domain Name us.example.com is a valid    |
  |                             | sub-domain name of example.com               |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | Zone Name                   | Any part of a domain that is configured      |
  |                             | in a DNS server and which fully contains     |
  |                             | the Domain Name for which the owner is       |
  |                             | authoritative, for instance example.com,     |
  |                             | us.example.com are Zone names. A zone is     |
  |                             | an operational convenience for DNS software  |
  |                             | and not part of the domain naming hierarchy. |
