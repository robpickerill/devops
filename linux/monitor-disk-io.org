* Description
  A script is to be created to monitor disk i/o. If the disk usage
  exceeds a specific threshold, the script should trigger an
  action. That action will kill the process which is throttling the
  disk usage.

* Idea
  We can use =df= utility of linux to monitor available free space and
  take actions accordingly.

* df command
  df reports the disk space usage of the mounted file systems.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ df -h
  udev            1.9G  4.0K  1.9G   1% /dev
  tmpfs           385M  1.4M  383M   1% /run
  /dev/sda5        20G   14G  5.6G  71% /
  none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
  none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
  none            1.9G  1.7M  1.9G   1% /run/shm
