* DNS Terminology
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | *Term                       | Definition and Usage*                        |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | Domain Name                 | A Domain Name has a registered owner         |
  |                             | and the owner is authoritative and           |
  |                             | responsible for DNS information.             |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | Fully Qualified Domain Name | Defines a domain name to the root.           |
  | (FQDN)                      | A FQDN must therefore include the root       |
  |                             | which in turn means it must have a           |
  |                             | final DOT on the extreme right of the        |
  |                             | domain name. For example                     |
  |                             | www.example.com. is a FQDN whereas           |
  |                             | www.example.com is not (it does not          |
  |                             | terminate with a DOT)                        |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | host name                   | Fully defines a host within a domain,        |
  |                             | for example, fred.example.com is a host      |
  |                             | name.                                        |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | sub-domain name             | A sub-domain name will fully include         |
  |                             | the Domain Name us.example.com is a valid    |
  |                             | sub-domain name of example.com               |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | Zone Name                   | Any part of a domain that is configured      |
  |                             | in a DNS server and which fully contains     |
  |                             | the Domain Name for which the owner is       |
  |                             | authoritative, for instance example.com,     |
  |                             | us.example.com are Zone names. A zone is     |
  |                             | an operational convenience for DNS software  |
  |                             | and not part of the domain naming hierarchy. |

* Name Server
  As our network grows we start to build up a serious number of Names
  in our Name Server (database). This gives rise to following three
  problems:
  1. Lot of names - Searching becomes slow.
  2. All the queries come to single name server, load becomes very high.
  3. Administration and updation of entries becomes difficult.

* DNS concepts and implementation
  The Internet's Domain Name Service (DNS) is just a specific
  implementation of the Name Server concept optimized for the
  prevailing conditions on the internet.

  From the brief history of name servers following three needs
  emerged:
  1. The need for a hierarchy of names.
  2. The need to separate operational loads on our name servers.
  3. The need to delegate the administration of our name servers.

  The Internet Domain Name System elegantly solves all these problems
  [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035][(RFC 1034)]]. 

** Domains and Delegation
   The Domain Name System uses a tree (or hierarchical) name
   structure. At the top of the tree is the root followed by the Top
   level Domains (TLDs) then the domain-name and any number of lower
   levels each separated with a dot.

*** Authority and Delegation
    The concepts of Delegation and Authority lies at the core of the
    domain name system hierarchy. The authority of the root domain
    lies with (ICANN). The generic top level domains are
    authoritatively administered by ICANN and delegated to a series of
    accredited registrars.

    Consider following example:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    www.us.example.com
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    Its domain name is =example.com=, =www= probably indicates a web
    site.
    
    The owner can delegate, in any way they want, anything to the left
    of the domain name they own. The owner is also responsible for
    administering this delegation which means running, or delegating
    the task of running, a DNS containing Authoritative information
    (or records) for their Domain Name (or zone).
