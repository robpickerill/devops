* Introduction
  This document describes the logical volume management.

* lvm
  LVM stands for logical volume management. It is a system of managing logical
  volumes, or filesystems, that is much more advanced and flexible than the
  traditional method of parititioning a disk into one or more segments and
  formatting that paritition with a filesystem.

** Basics
   There are three concepts that LVM manages:
*** Volume Groups
*** Physical Volumes
*** Logical Volumes
